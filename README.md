# Tiny25_drivers
## Motivation
I was to bored to code an STM32 by following tutes, i needed to test my skills on
something raw and hardcore. challenge was really simple, make drivers without any help,
pure old highschool spanking. This is a proof that i can read datasheets.

also i drank too much coffee.

I tried SPI driver recently and this are the results for the three wire communication.
